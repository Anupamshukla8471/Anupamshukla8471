## 🧠 About Me

I'm an enthusiastic developer passionate about uncovering insights from data and building ML models that actually *work*. Whether it’s predicting Titanic survivors or diagnosing liver conditions, I enjoy combining logic, stats, and just a touch of code magic.

> 🧪 Despite being a Data Scientist, I still whisper _"please"_ to my code when debugging…  
> And it works **72.3% of the time** — yes, I ran the stats! 📊😄
